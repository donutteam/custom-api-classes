# Custom API Classes
A collection of classes to simplify building and communicating with custom APIs.

We created this in order to expedite development of the Donut Team API and it is being made available to potentially assist other developers in developing their own custom APIs.

## Installation
Install the package with NPM:

```
npm install @donutteam/custom-api-classes

## Documentation
Documentation will be coming at a later date.
